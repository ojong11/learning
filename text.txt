how to create a docker image

create a dicrectory 
     example: Dockerfile
 then navigate into that directory
       example: cd Dockerfile
 create file example: touch or vi Dockerfile
      you will be promted to write an image.

 please move to you dockerhub account  and check the image if it is existing or maybe you have created an image whatever the case maybe.
 
 FROM is the base image
 COPY in this case referes to where the image is going to be copied 
 
 FROM nginx
 COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

 save and quit that file
 point to be noted make sure you are creating the file in the directory you created.

 make a simple file since we already stated it above so touch a file in that same directory example:touch or vi index.html you can write anything if you wish 

 move to you dockerhub and get the repo you created example:repoNama/application

now copy it out and run the command : docker build -t repoName/application:tagName...... which means docker build -t repoName/application:latest or v2 and then hit enter to start creating image. 

when it is done run "docker images" to see if it created 
note that this image will not be present in ur remote repo

now you have to push it to ur remote repo example: docker push repoName/application/latest or v2 the hit enter.
